**Python Simple Calculator Report **
Introduction 
The simple calculator program in Python is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and averaging. It takes user input, processes the operation, and displays the result accordingly. 
Program Structure 
The program follows a structured approach with three main steps: 
1.	Defining Functions for Operations o 	add(num1, num2): Returns the sum of two numbers. o 	sub(num1, num2): Returns the difference between two numbers. o 	multiply(num1, num2): Returns the product of two numbers. o 	divide(num1, num2): Returns the quotient of two numbers. 
	o 	avg(num1, num2): Returns the average of two numbers. 
2.	User Input o 	The program prompts the user to select an operation (1-5). 
	o 	It then asks for two integer inputs from the user. 
3.	Processing and Output o 	The program checks the user's selection and calls the corresponding function. 
o	It then prints the result in a readable format. 
o	If the user selects an invalid option, an error message is displayed. Example Output 
Please select an operation: 
1.	Addition 
2.	Subtraction 
3.	Multiplication 
4.	Division 
5.	Average 
Select an operation from 1,2,3,4,5: 1 
Enter first number: 5 
Enter second number: 3 
5 + 3 = 8 
Key Features 
•	User-Friendly Interface: Clear prompts for user input. 
•	Error Handling: Checks for invalid selections. 
•	Function-Based Approach: Modular and reusable code structure. 
•	Simple Arithmetic Operations: Covers basic mathematical functions. 
Potential Improvements 
•	Implement exception handling to prevent division by zero errors. 
•	Add more operations such as modulus and exponentiation. 
•	Allow floating-point inputs for more precise calculations. 
•	Provide a loop to allow multiple calculations without restarting the program. 
Conclusion 
This simple calculator demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts, including functions, user input handling, and conditional statements. It serves as a useful starting point for beginners learning how to structure and implement basic computational programs in Python.
